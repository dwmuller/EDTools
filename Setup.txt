* Flight checklist

- Load Elite_Dangerous profile in X56.
- Start ED either from Library or from SteamVR.
- Verify The Miller Kbd Base bindings loaded in ED.
- Start VoiceAttack via desktop Steam. (Hard to locate via SteamVR.)
- Resume!


* Software

- Logitech X56 Profiler
- Voice Attack (standalone version, registered)
- EDDI (as a Voice Attack plugin)

* Services

- EDDN
- EDSM - uses Frontier (ED developer) credentials

* Quirks

If you start VoiceAttack before SteamVR, VA correctly sees the change of input device, but audio doesn't
get to it anyway. (Note: Changed exclusive setting on virtual input device, try again?)
